# Using Perforce for version control in game development

## Introduction
The paper focuses on the most important aspects of version control in game development by highlighting the main differences between practices applied in this area and version control practices used at more traditional branches of software development. Furthermore, the paper intends to demonstrate the typical workflow by showing the functionalities of the widely used [Helix Core&trade;](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core) from company [Perforce Software](https://www.perforce.com/).  
The paper is structured into three main sections: the first section gives an overview of version control principals and
concepts. The second discusses the main differences between software development and game development and how these translate into practice when it comes to version control.
The following final section showcases the Helix Core&trade; version control software.

## Section #1 - Overview of version control concepts
Distributed vs centralized version control systems (VCS). Workflows/definitions specific to distributed and centralized version control. Role of VCS in fast iterations and continuous integration / continuous development (CI/CD). 
Further benefits of using VCS. Cons / disadvantages of using version control.

## Section #2 - Video game development as software development
Game development is a special branch of software development. Main differences and similarities. Team composition and workflows. Typical workflow of game development project. Main roles and interactions in game development teams. Version control in game development. VCS applications used in game development.

## Section #3 - Version control using Helix Core
The section guides through the installation process of a VCS extensively used for game development and demonstrates main features with practical example using Godot game engine.
- Installation of [Helix Core Server and Helix GUI](https://help.perforce.com/helix-core/quickstart/Content/quickstart/admin-install-linux.html)  
- Using Helix Core with [Godot game engine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)
