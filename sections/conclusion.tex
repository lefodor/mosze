\section{Conclusion}
The paper gives a brief overview about the topic of version control in game development and guides through a demonstrative 
case study using \textbf{Helix Core}\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} from \textbf{Perforce Software} while developing
a basic 2D game with open source \textbf{Godot Engine}. \hfill \break
The first section (\ref{overview-version-control}) talks about version control in general, touch bases on main concepts
and principals that show up in the industry. The following section (\ref{game-development-sw}) investigates some aspects 
of game development process and discusses differences and similarities compared to traditional software development. 
The third and fourth parts (\ref{case-study-1} and \ref{case-study-2}) demonstrate the version control system in action, 
submitting changes, creating/merging/synchronizing branches from the point of view of game designer/coder and from that 
of art teams using dedicated streams and propagating changes from here throughout the whole project.
