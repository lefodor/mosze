  \paragraph{}
  The paper focuses on the most important aspects of version control in game development by highlighting the main 
  differences between practices applied in this area and version control practices used at more traditional branches 
  of software development. Furthermore, the paper intends to demonstrate the typical workflow by showing the 
  functionalities of the widely used \href{https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core}{Helix Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}} 
  from company \href{https://www.perforce.com/}{Perforce Software}.  
  The paper is structured into four main sections: the first section gives an overview of version control principals and
  concepts. The second discusses the most important differences between software development and game development and 
  how these translate into practice when it comes to version control.
  The following final sections showcase the Helix Core\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} version control software by building
  a very basic 2D game using the open-source game engine Godot Engine.
